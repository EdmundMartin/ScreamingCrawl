# ScreamingCrawl

An SEO Crawler meant to act as an frewware alternative to ScreamingFrog. There is a lot of work to be done.

## TODO
* Work out the most efficient way to write to SQLite when SQL output is set. Currently, is to slow.
* Add support for MongoDB.
* Package as a command line executable.
* Extend SEO parser - redirect history, and other useful information.
* Maybe add support for MongoDB???
* Proper logging
* Arg parsing from command line.
